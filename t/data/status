Description: PCM player designed for ALSA
 Alsaplayer is a PCM player designed specifically for use with ALSA, but
 works great with OSS or EsounD.  It's heavily threaded which cuts down on
 skipping, offers optional and even simultaneous visual scopes, plays
 mp3, mp2, ogg, cdda, audiofs, and lots more.
 .
 This empty package provides an easy transition to either the gtk or
 text frontends; it may be safely removed once all its dependencies
 are installed.
