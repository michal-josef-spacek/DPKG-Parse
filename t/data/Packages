Description: "Three-dimensional" desktop switcher
 3D-Desktop is an OpenGL program for switching virtual desktops in
 a seamless 3-dimensional manner.  The current desktop is mapped into a
 fullscreen 3D environment where you may choose other screens.  Several
 different visualization modes are available.  A window manager
 compatible with the GNOME pager standard is required.
 .
 The transition from working desktop to fullscreen 3D environment is
 seamless: when the pager activates you see your current desktop appear
 to zoom out to a point in space where you can see your other virtual
 desktops allowing you to select another.
 .
 The program is rather memory-hungry and it is CPU intensive, but it's
 accessible from the command line, which makes it perfect for show
 floors and impressing your non-UN*X-using friends.
